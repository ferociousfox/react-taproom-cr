## Notes:

* _today's project was fairly straight-forward, much like the week has been_

* _the only portion of the work today that gave me any trouble was relearning css. I hadn't done much in the javascript course. So, I had to spend some time referencing "CSS tricks" to refresh myself on flex-box, grid and almost everything else I wanted to do._
